  <p>First, go to https://github.com/search?q= and search ultra-learn owner:pretzer25 in the searchbar</p>
 <br>
   <p> Secondly, if you have a github account, fork this repository, if not make one</p>
<br>

  <p>then click add site in the middle of the page, import from existing project and give permission</p>
  <br>
  <p> now select the repository that is forked from ultra-learn, your site name is basically your first letters of your site name, leave all the build settings emty, delete if something is in them</p>
