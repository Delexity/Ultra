<h1>Welcome, This is a Short tutorial on how to make your own ultra-learn</h1>
  <p>First, go to https://github.com/search?q= and search ultra-learn owner:pretzer25 in the searchbar</p>
 <br>
   <p> Secondly, if you have a github account, fork this repository, if not make one</p>
<br>
<p> Now go to vercel.com and register your github account there</p>
  <br>
  <p> now select the repository that is forked from ultra-learn, your project name is basically your first letters of your site name, for ex: PROJECTNAME-RANDOMWORD.VERCEL.APP</p>
  <br>
  <p>Without changing anything, click deploy and get your site!</p>
  <br>
  <p>To keep your site updated, check your own github repository after each day and sync changes (this option is showed above all the code)<p>
<h2> ONE LAST THING, DO NOT CHANGE ANY OF THE CODE, OR ELSE I WILL LEGALLY HAVE TO PUT A LISENCE THAT STATES THAT NO CHANGES CAN BE MADE TO THE SITE AND DISABLE MAKING YOUR OWN SITES FOR A TIME. <h2>
